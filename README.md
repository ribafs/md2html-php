# Markdown-to-HTML Converter for PHP
**[md2html.php](src/md2html.php) is a simple PHP script that converts markdown to HTML.** There are several similar converters available online, but this project aims to be simpler and easier to customize than the rest. 

### Features

* Full support for tables
* Automatic anchor links for headings
* Syntax highlighting with automatic language detection
* All styling uses a CSS file (with a Github-lookalike one provided)

### Example
Copy the files from [/demo](demo) to your web server and request [demo.php](/demo/demo.php)
 
### Resources
* [Parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) is a similar project that is more performant and has more features, but is a lot more complex and intimidating to modify.
